Welcome to my profile Sixsinglebird, 

Im a canadian citizen living on the east coast.
I'm a amateur developer, still in school, and a beekeeper (not by trade).
I have 3 dogs, (I) had a fourth buddy but we recently lost him to old age.
11 years old and a pug is impressive.
Hope you enjoy what i have posted.

  Cheers,
Six
